# EV Data Analysis

This project analyzes global Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover trends in EV adoption across different regions.

## Project Structure

- **ev car analysis.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, visualizations, and code.
- **Global EV Data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis, containing global EV statistics.
- **ev car report.pbit**: Power BI template for further data visualization and reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the required libraries using:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Open `ev car analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure `Global EV Data.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Reads and preprocesses the EV dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Summarizes and visualizes EV trends by region, year, and parameter.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares EV adoption in China, USA, India, and globally.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes means, trends, and regression analysis for future predictions.
- **Visualization**: Generates line plots, bar charts, and regression plots for insights.
- **Power BI Report**: Use `ev car report.pbit` for interactive dashboards.

## Example Visualizations

- World and regional EV sales trends (2011-2015)
- Mean EV data comparison for China, USA, and India
- Regression plots predicting future EV adoption

## Usage

You can modify the notebook to explore other regions, parameters, or time periods. The code is modular and can be extended for deeper analysis.
